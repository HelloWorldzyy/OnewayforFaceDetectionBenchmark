this project is a realization of face detection based on sfd.It reaches top 5 on FDDB contests unpublished way. I also used it on Wideface, reach a top 3 result.

You can download the pretrained model from here
https://pan.baidu.com/s/1NEW47LcsFKVPEm24D9ckFQ

the caffe-sfd is revised based on caffe-ssd.so you can just
configure it in the same way with ssd.

Train:
As fddb has some un-comment human face, you need to use our datasets,which have more face.

 
eval:
cd $SFD_ROOT/sfd_test_code/FDDB
 
python fddb_test.py

Pay attention you shuold not change the square result into circle
use the offical evaluation tool, you need to use us Fiting.m do that change, it can get better result.
